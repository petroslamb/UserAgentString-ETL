'''

This is the daemon service that handles download, de/compression, and file upload.

Usage: run the file which includes daemon process

TODO: The transformation of files is the next step. 
Daemon could be implemented with python-daemon for niceness.

Although the test explicitly states that there should be manipulation through files, 
send_file returned a BadRequest so I implemented everything with contents anyway.
Its cleaner and could have speed advantages, although network is the bottleneck here.

TODO: After implementing service, exception handling could log certain errors, 
without halting daemon.
