Hello,

First task is complete. It has taken time, as my experience with python is limited. It is, however, the language I prefer to work with. 

For task two I would probably have used redis, which I already needed for geodis, a library for geolocation, that does not limit the number of lookups, as online APIs do. 

As I am not familiar with redis, I am not sure this would be the best solution, but I noticed that it has a clean API with useefull tools like counters, expiration on keys, hashes and ordered sets, along with redis-py for good python integration. Possibly the use of a callback for the hourly expiration.

I did not get to the third task.

It has been an interesting test overall, please feel free to contact me on any questions.

Best Regards,
Petros
